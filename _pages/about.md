# The Me
Hello, This is Ethereal.
I set this place up to be able to share some longer posts & maybe even some conclusions, this is also a place to store my future **Shadow-wiki**.
    
As for me, I'm a 19yo cybersecurity enthusiast, I do programming on occasions (mainly in low-level languages like C, or scripts with Python and Perl), I am obsessed with privacy and free & open-source software and I aim to spread its word.

The main method of contacting me is through email : []()[Ethereal@duck.com](mailto:ethereal@duck.com)
# The Wiki

The wiki is mainly a place to store either:
- Anonymity focused software
- Privacy focused software

And also to compare different solutions in different use-cases over time, it's also up for contribution, if anyone is interested to discuss me on it.
# The website

The website is built using Jekyll, it is published using Surge, and it's currently using the [Pure-log](https://github.com/brennanbrown/purelog) template. Cool guy, cool theme.
