> Send me to Hell
> Or to the gallows . . .

Primordial has a song, It's called ["To hell, or the Hangman"](https://open.spotify.com/track/112gP3mthdcaWWQ9vXVQlz?si=5aa15dbbaa8a4010), I was listening to it yesterday afternoon and it got me thiking, what would i prefer?

That sounds like a stupid question, and it is, because i randomly opened Emacs and started to write something i had no intention of writing in the first place, I was mostly excited to try out this  `date +"%M-%m-%d"` command that i constructed for Jekyll, but now I'm hooked.

We've seen life to be a series of terrible choices, between one's that hurt and between shooting yourself in the foot, kinda like C++,
Now here's today question, Hell or the hangman?

## That's absurd!
Yes, that's a stupid question, but let's build further on it anyways, (kinda like C++)

## Hell, Let's be real, none of us is going to heaven

Hell is a complicated place man, Many religions describe hell in their own, fucked up way, Considering there's [~4200 religions in the world](https://www.reference.com/world-view/many-religions-world-8f3af083e8592895) and each of them has a form of divine punishment (aka hell) and some requirements to get to these places, I, personally, go to hell in about 4100 of them, so i gotta get ready for what's about to come.

Dante's hell is specifically poetic, but it's still, hell.
you cannot hide a beast in a dress of beauty and expect it to not be a beast, so, It's still hell, even so very poetic

> Through me you pass into the grievous city,
>
> Through me you pass into eternal pain,
>
> Through me you pass among the lost people . . .
>
> Abandon all hope, you who enter here.

FUCK NO, NOPE, I'M OUT OF HERE.

so we had two pretty mean hells so far, but what about the gallows, what do they mean? what does it mean to go to the hangman?

## Hangman, or there lack of

It's not the Hangman you should be afraid of, or rather, you should,
I'd like to interpret this statement as not getting executed by them, and rather fearing that you might, as someone who lives in a society of repression, I know what means, most people live in fear of death until they get consumed by the very thing they're so afraid of getting killed by the thing they swore to obey, a monster they grew, raised fed and then failed to tame.
Here's where hell start's looking merciful, when you see the thousands of people living like sheep, existing under a flase flag and going through their whole life without ever.. *Mattering*, Hell looks like a reward, In hell, your pain, agony and misery *means something*.


## Me?

Personally, I think there's no punishment worse than being unremarkable and worthless, and even in the face of *Abandoning all hope* or *Pissed off flames*, Not mattering is a far worse punishment.
> Now tell me, what would you do?
