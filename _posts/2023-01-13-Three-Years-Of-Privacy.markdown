## Paranoia, or not
When I started my trip down the rabbit-hole of privacy it seemed to most as fuel for one's paranoia, and it might just have been that.
But as i went further and further down the hole I realized the comfort in owning your own data.

## The world around us
The world we live in has turned into a world of forensics, every human's worth gets measured in the amount of value their data provides, and so the free services we use on a daily basis use the said value to pay for their costs,
With every tech giant comes a data collection giant, This applies to Facebook (Meta, who changed their name to use legal loopholes BTW...), Google, Amazon, etc.

## The bigger threat

The fact is, all these big companies still have to obey some laws, the bigger threats are the smaller, unknown / sketchy companies that have to obey no borders in data collection and can do what they wish, Now that's fucked up.

## The Cost of Privacy

Mostly, FREE.
Not always though,
