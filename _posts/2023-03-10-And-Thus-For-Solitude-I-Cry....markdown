> “I have absolutely no pleasure in the stimulants in which I sometimes so madly indulge. It has not been in the pursuit of pleasure that I have periled life and reputation and reason. It has been the desperate attempt to escape from torturing memories, from a sense of insupportable loneliness and a dread of some strange impending doom.”

## Beast Or God

Solitude is a rather touchy subject amongst thinkers, Francis Bacon’s essay Of Friendship, on it's first line states:
>“Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god”

What differs God from a vile beast? What really is the difference? A beast devours what we keep faith in, and a God devours what we don't. Gods and beasts alike, feed off of what we use to define ourselves as humans, a person with beliefs may never be alone, and thus a wild beast with beliefs must not exist. But in nature, gods are vile beasts, we cannot tell us apart from beasts, gods or whatever's in-between, we are an unholy breed of a holy beast, waiting to devour to survive, it's the food we take in, our social life, humans, it is all means to satisfy our hunger for others.

## Progress.
